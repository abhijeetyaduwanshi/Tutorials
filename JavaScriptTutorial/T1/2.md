How and where to use the JS script in our HTML webpage?
We have options, we can put the script in the head or we can put the script in the body as well
Then we can again put a reference to the external JS file or we can put a inline block of code

- External script placed in the head
- Inline block of script placed in the head
- External script placed in the body
- Inline block of script placed in the body

So for external or inline script it depends on what we are trying to do, if we have our application code somewhere and have a JS library we want to put that as a external file and then load it using the script tag in the src attribute

Advantages of external JS script
Script can be cached, minified, many js files can be combined into one making only one http request, simplifies and improve the performance of the page

Next qestion will be, when to use the inline JS in the head?
When JS is really small like few lines or using any analytics, then use the JS inline, specially in the head section, or before any other JS for the analytics part and this is the only exception other than that I will highly recommend to put the JS as a external script

Next question is script in the head or just before ending the body?
HTML code is parsed same as other programming languages, line by line starting from the top, if we put the script in the head and the execution hits the script, it stops the HTML parsing and starts to download the script and not even render the page on the UI

If we have multiple scripts then our browser will download all of the scripts and then continue with the HTML parsing

On a slow network if we put the scripts in the head then the browser will take time to download and execute the scripts and for that time the user will be seeing white screen, this will be considered as a poor design

In short scripts block parallel downloading. Delays rendering of the page

Because of this put the JS script as the last element of the body, this will get all the html and download the styles which can be done in parallel and will start rendering the page, the user will see the page properly even on a slow network and then it will download and execute the JS script

TIP: JS scripts are downloaded sequencially, meaning that the script put first will be downloaded and executed first
HTTP has recomemded to use atmost 2 scripts per host at a time, but modern browsers can download 6 sripts per host at a same time in parallel

So for this there are a few ways that we can prevent this from happening, we can combine multiple JS files into one, there are tools available that can do that, which is a part of UI performance improvement

But there are other alternative methods to improve this placement of the JS scripts
