Variables and datatypes in JS

When talking about variables we learn how to declare variables in JS, not initializing just declaring
So in JS we declare the variables using "var" keyword

```
var firstName; // declares variable in the current scope.
var firstName, lastName = "Script", address, city;
```

Remember, Always use a "var" keyword when declaring the variables in JS
Even if we do not use a "var" keyword the variable will be declared, but the scope of the variable will be global even if we declare a variable inside a function

This is just declaring the variable, one thing to notice when we compare this with any other programming language is that there is no datatype. Not like int, boolean, string or anything else

So that means that the variables don't have a datatype as of now

But wait, lastName has a datatype

In JS datatype is assigned only we assign a value to it

```
var lastName - "Script"
```

So as soon as we assign a string to a variable then the variable will say "now I am a string"

But initially, if we don't assign a value to a variable, the variable data type is as actually undefined

And this is the first data type in JS
And this Undefined datatype is not there in C/C++ or Java

This means that the variable is never initialized, no value and it has no datatype but this makes a guarantee that there is a variable which is declared

So in short when we declare a variable JS automatically assigns undefined datatype to it, but only if we do not initialize it, but later it can be assigned to a value programmatically

Not to check whether the undefined story is right or not we can use the plunker (https://plnkr.co/)

Now declare a variable and log it in the console

```
var firstName;
console.log(firstName);
```

It has got the value of undefined
It's not a string its a datatype

And to further get the datatype of any variable we can always use "typeof" operator, and this will tell us the datatype of that variable

```
var firstName;
console.log(typeof firstName); // prints undefined to the console
```

We can also assign undefined to a variable but it is pretty useless

```
var firstName = undefined;
console.log(typeof firstName); // prints undefined to the console
```

Next datatype in the list is null, we will find null in all the programming languages like Java, C/C++

In JS as well we have null

Meaning the variable exists, datatype is known but the value is not known

Other programming languages treat null, they just point to the first memory location which is almost zero

Same story here

```
var firstName = null;
```

As a developer we have to assign the variable to null, JS will never assign null to the variable

Now if we check the datatype of the variable which is assigned to null

```
var firstName = null;
console.log(typeof firstName); // prints object to the console
```

This means that object is datatype in JS, so any variable assigned to a value null is of the type of object

So the type is known, the variable exists the only thing is that we don't know the value

TIP: null is never a datatype in JS, the datatype is always object
