Typecasting in JS

One thing with variables in JS, since there is no strict checking for the datatype, the typecasting is very simple

Typecasting means that changing a variable of one datatype to another datatype, and there is a very different typecasting concept in JAVA C/C++

So once you assign a value to a variable it will recognize the type of value and assign itself the datatype and the value.

later we can assign a different value of different datatype and the variable will update itself and assign the new datatype and the new value.

```
var myVar = 23;
console.log("value - " + myVar + ", datatype - " + typeof myVar);

// more code

myVar = "I have changes the value from 23 to twenty three";
console.log("value - " + myVar + ", datatype - " + typeof myVar);
```

remember the most recent value of the variable is the current value that the variable holds

Then we have JS operators

Starting with Arithmetic
```
// all usual arithemetic operators +, -, *, / and %

// + operator is used for addition as well as for concatenation

var x = 5 + 10; // x = 15;

var y = "Hello" + " " + "World"; // y = "Hello World"

// important
var z = "3" + 4 + 5; // z = ?; dayatype = ?;
var zz = 3 + 4 + "5"; // zz = ?; dayatype = ?;
```

So plus can be used for both adding 2 numeric values and it can also be used to concatenate 2 string values

concatenation is just like gluing 2 things one after other

Since JS doesn't do type checking strictly, then how does it determine whether it has to do the summation or concatenation

So when both the values on either side of the plus operator are numeric then it does summation, but if either one of the value is a string it will concatenate

Like this example, var z = "3" + 4 + 5; the resultant solution "345" and the datatype is a string

This is because the execution of any statement in JS starts from left and ends in right, also JS evaluates one operation at a time

It had string 3 and numeric 4in first time, and as I said earlier if any value on either side of the operator is a string, then this will concatenate the value. The result after the first operation will be string value "34" and number value 5;

Again in second-time same story string and number, will do the concatenation and the resultant will be string value of "345"

In this second example var zz = 3 + 4 + "5";
So in this te returned datatype is a string and the value is "75", how two numeric values 3 plus 4 will do the summation giving us 7, then in second operator it will have 7 of numeric and 5 of string, since one is numeric and other is string this will do the concatenation giving us "75" of string

Now there is something in JS that has no explanation

```
0.1 + 0.1 = ?;

well that simple its 0.2

Ok then, what is 0.1 + 0.2 = ?;

it's not 0.3; not exactly, it's this 0.30000000000000004
```

The reason is floating point number system, and how browsers handle floating point numbers according to ECMA specification

Now there is only one datatype number, no differentiation for integer or float or double
Also, 1.1 + 1.3 will have something wired

Logical operators
```
/*
&& represents and
|| represents or
! represents not
*/
``` 

Next is conditional operators this is the short form of if else loop

```
var myVar = (condition) ? value_if_true : value_if_false;
```

so a regularly if else looks something like

```
var myVar = 100;
var another;

if(myVar == 200) {
console.log(another = "equal");
	} else {
console.log(another = "notEqual");
	}
```

so here we initialize the variable another, the value is based on the condition but we have a lot of code here to simplify this we can have a one-liner, ok before this in the above code I am initializing and printing the result in the same line, also single equal is an assignment operator and double equals is the comparative operator, also the assignment operator the code flows from right to left

```
eg:
var myVar = 100;
var another = (myVar == 200) ? "equal" : "notEqual";
```

we do something similar in Java and other programming languages, this conditional operator is pretty common
