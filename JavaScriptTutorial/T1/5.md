String
One of the easiest one

Anything and everything, if the value is in quotes the value is a string value

There are 2 ways that we can assign a string value to a variable

```
// just assign a value to it like we normally do it in Java and other programming languages
var firstName = 'JavaScript';

// or we can use a string constructor
var firstName = new String('JavasScript'); // for this we have to use valueOf() to get the value

// we have access to all the string functions like length, indexOf(), substring(), toLowerCase(), toUpperCase(), trim(), charAt() and many more

// can use double or single quotes. But make a choice and be consistent with it
alert('Hello World');
alert("Hello World");
// there is no difference in JS if we use single or double quotes, but this makes a big difference in Java, PHP, and other programming languages

var firstName = new String('JavaScript');
console.log(firstName.valueOf()); // this is how we get the value of the variable in a constructor string
```

The constructor is not that used that often, regular way is most used and is recommended

Now the difference between the regular string and the constructor string is that

The regular way of initializing string | using constructor to initialize string
-------------------------------- | --------------------------------------
typeof regular string gives us string as a result | typeof constructor string gives us an object as a result
log the regular string will give us the value of the variable | log the constructor string will give us an instance of the string object, which has a different toString() function
We get the value of the variable in a regular string when we use it | to get the value of the variable in a constructor string we have to use the valueOf() function if we initialize the variable with the constructor

So as soon as we initialize a variable with a string value the variable becomes of type of string

And this is the way JS maintains datatypes

```
var firstName = "JavaScript";
console.log(typeof firstName); // output is string
```

If we put the value of this as a number say 1000

```
var firstName = 1000;
console.log(typeof firstName); // output is number
```

So a variable in JS can have any value, including a function

Next is boolean

Again there are 2 ways that we can assign a boolean value to a variable

```
// regular way
var myVar = true;
var myVar = false;

// or we can use a boolean constructor
var myVar = new Boolean(); // default value is false, have to use valueOf() function to get the value of the variable
var myVar = new Boolean(true); // initialize the variable with a true value, have to use valueOf() function to get the value of the variable

// TIP 0, -0, null, "", '', undefined, NaN, false : these all evaluates to false;

var myVar;
if(!myVar) {
	// this will execute the loop because a value which has not been initialized is of undefined datatype which evaluates to false 
}
```

Remember one thing, boolean does not have any quotes, if we put quotes then this becomes a string

Interesting thing, when we log the console the color of string is black and the color of boolean and numbers are blue

Now with JS and other programming languages
Other languages we can not put non-boolean variables in the conditional expressions, but we can do it here

```
var myVar = 0;

if(myVar) {
	console.log("This is true");
} else {
	console.log("This is false");
}
```
