Numbers

```
var n = 34; // numeric value without quotes will be considered as a number
// or
var n = new Number (value); // this value can be a string as well. Use valueOf() to get the value of the variable

// if value is not in a number formate, NaN returned which can be checked using isNaN() function

if(isNaN(n)){
	// n is not a number;
}

/*
methods like: toFixed(), toPrecision() etc.

parseInt(string, radix); // parse a string into integer using radix (2, 8, 10, 16) base. First number is returned.
parseFloat(string); // oarse a string into float number. First number is returned.

Math objects have methods like abs, rounding, random, trigonometric, log, and other methods.

```

In JS we can directly initialize a variable with a number with number or numeric datatype by just assigning a number value to it;

```
var myVar = 1000;
console.log(myVar); // gives you the value of the variable
```

We can also use the number constructor to do the same

```
var myVar = new Number(1000);
console.log(myVar.valueOf()); // but for this we will have to use the valueOf() function to get the value of the variable
```

But number constructor has an advantage over all the others

What is the value passed to the constructor is a string?

Suppose the value is a string that we have to convert into a number value, in this case, our number constructor is useful

```
var myStringNumber = "123456789";

var myVar = new Number(myStringNumber);
console.log(myVar.valueOf());
```

If we log this in console we can see the difference in color which indicates that we have a number value in the end and not a string

But wait what if we put something that is a non-numeric valued string in the constructor?

```
var myStringNumber = "This is a string and not a number";

var myVar = new Number(myStringNumber);
console.log(myVar.valueOf());
```

This will give us a result as "NaN"
Also, our variable myVar will not be initialized
And will not be assigned to any value, instead, it will be assigned to a constant NaN (not a number)

In JS there is a special conditional to check if the variable is a number type or not, isNaN condition

```
var myStringNumber = "This is a string and not a number";

var myVar = new Number(myStringNumber);

if(isNaN(myVar)){
	console.log("not a number")
} else {
	console.log("value is a number")
}
```

Use of this there is a form and we want the user to enter their age which will definitely a number

It depends on what we handle that as a number or a string because inputs are always string, but NaN is going to make a final validation that the given value is a number or not

Now there are 2 more functions apart from the constructor that we can use to typecast the number type

```
parseInt(), and parseFloat();
```

so instead of constructor we can just put parseInt()

```
var myVar = parseInt("1234edden5678")
console.log(myVar); // result is 1234
```

Well this is a little different than our number constructor, our number constructor will check for the entire string before converting it to a numeric value
parseInt(), tries its best to convert the string value into a numeric value, this is done one by one
As soon as it encounters a character it will stop

So it will return the numbered value of the string until the first character

If our string is fully numeric value then they do the same work

But wait, the outcome of the result, when used parseInt(), is a decimal number

parseInt() has more work to do
This can convert a binary number to decimal
So if we pass a binary number in it
We can also pass a base or a radix with it, then and only then we can get a decimal representation of the binary
We separate the string and the base with a comma, just like passing 2 arguments in it

```
var myVar = parseInt("1001001110", 2);
console.log(myVar); // this will give a required decimal number in the results; 590
```

Same with hexadecimal numbers, the base will be 16

```
var myVar = parseInt("A34534F", 16);
console.log(myVar); // this will give a required decimal number in the results; 171201359
```

Same thing with octal and decimal itself

parseFloat();

Anytime we dealing with strings containing decimal numbers, we can get the floating point as well

```
var myVar = parseFloat("234345.345");
console.log(myVar); // result is 234345.345
```

If we use the parseInt() in the variable with a string having decimal numbers then only the integer part of the variable will be returned and not the decimal part

On the number datatype we have toFixed(), toPrecision() functions as well

For a decimal number having a lot of decimal digits, we can use toFixed() and pass the value of the numbers that we need after decimal to get the limited decimal digits

```
var myVar = 234345.345677;
console.log(myVar.toFixed(2)); // this will give us 234345.34
```

This will give us the fixed decimal number and will also do the rounding

We can also use toPrecision() if we want the limited digits in the result

Precision is the degree to the closeness of a number in short form

```
var myVar = 234345.345677;
console.log(myVar.toPrecision(2)); // this will give us 2.3e+5
```

This will be returned in an equivalent notation, maybe scientific
