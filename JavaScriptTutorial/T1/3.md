Now most of the websites like Yahoo, Twitter, FaceBook, Google they all place the JS in the head

They are doing that because they are using the alternative improved method

They are using "defer" or "async" attribute in the script tag

These are 2 new attributes that came up with the script tag

Now to make sure that you're using the attribute that is supported by all the browsers you can always use (https://caniuse.com/)

So with the use of these 2 attributes, you can place the script in the head

Definitions:
defer: downloads the file during HTML parsing and will only execute it after the parser has complete. Execution order is guaranteed
This is just as same as putting the script in the bottom of the page

async: download the file during HTML parsing and will pause the HTML parser to execute it when it has finished downloading

Now if we talk about CSS we always should be loading the CSS in the head, because if we put the CSS at the bottom then the user will first see the HTML text on a white background if the CSS is taking time to load
Second thing is that HTML parsing will take place once then the CSS will be downloaded and then again the code will run on the same HTML page and in this second round the CSS will be attached to the corresponding HTML elements, so twice the work

TIP: HTML parsing is done only and only once, if we are running on the page then that is called as rendering; rendering can be done more than one time (multiple times)

Now as far as input and output functions are concerned
So for most of the programming languages, we write "Hello world" program
In JS we don't have traditional system.out.print to print the results
Because the console available to us is in the browser and not in the editor, because our editor or IDE is not executing the script its the browser doing that, hence we have the console in the browser only, so anytime we want to log something the functions are "console.log()" and "console.dir()" depending on what we are trying to do

Back in the day people use to use "alerts()" when we were not having CDT or developer tools, the reason for not using the alert is because alert works synchronously, meaning as soon as the code hits alert it will stop execution of the script until we click ok or cancel or do something with that alert, whereas console works async, meaning that it will not stop the script
Also, we can put breakpoints in the debugger and can step the execution of the code

So for most of the time console will be used to monitor the execution of our web application, all the errors and other issues related to the application will be seen in the console

Now if we have some code that is browser specific, meaning that the code will work in one browser and not in the other browser we have to take care of that and there are some automated tools to do that like Grunt

Also as a developer we do not have access to the console log from the browser, meaning if there is any problem in the front end the server will not know the problem because both front end and back end are handled separately
Also if the issue occurs the problem can be seen in the user's browsers, not transferring anything to the server

So, for this reason, we have to design our application with a reporting mechanism so that this console.log() on the user's machine can be recorded on the server asynchronously and then can be taken care of

JS is case sensitive and each statement in JS should be ended with a semi-colon
