Project name: Calculate the volume and surface area of a pyramid

Author: Abhijeet Yaduwanshi

Project for: learning java

Skills used: core java

This programs is one of my early java learning lessons.
This time I came up with the same steps as that of I used in the cylinder program. The only thing is that I used the inbuilt square-root and power functions.

The program is about calculating the volume and surface area of a pyramid.

The program welcome's the user and then asks the user to enter their name.
The program then greets the user with their name.

The program then asks the user to enter the length, width and height for the pyramid.

Finally the program do all the calculations and give the final results.
