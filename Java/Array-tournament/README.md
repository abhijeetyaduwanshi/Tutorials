Project name: Calculate the maximum in the given n numbers by saving the values in the array tree

Author: Abhijeet Yaduwanshi

Project for: Data structures and algorithms learning

Skills used: core java

This programs is one of my early data structures and algorithms learning lessons.

In this program I tried learn the basics of data structures and algorithms by taking a simple case study II of finding the maximum of given n numbers and saving the values in a array tree.

The program greets the user with the program name and prompts the user to enter their name and says hello user.
The program asks the user to enter the length of the numbers (n).
The program asks the user to enter the numbers.
The program then stores the values in the array from the values starting from location n. (eg: n = 5, then the first number will be stored at location 5 in the array and so on.)
Then the program compares the number values at location i and i+1 and returns the maximum of the two and stores it in i/2 location of the array. (eg: i = 5, i+1 = 6 where i = 8, and i+1 = 9, so the maximum i.e. 6 will be stored at the location 4 and so on.)
The program then compares the resultant and saves the value in the i/2 location until the final maximum is stored in the array at location 1.

The block diagram of the comparison is explained in Even.PNG and Odd.PNG for both odd and even cases.
The final result is shown in PEven.PNG, and POdd.PNG.
