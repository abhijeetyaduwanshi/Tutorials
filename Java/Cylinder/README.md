Author: Abhijeet Yaduwanshi

Project for: learning java

Skills used: core java


This programs is one of my early java learning lessons.
Computer is capable enough of doing complex calculations but before that we need to put formulas and code it accordingly to make it do that.

Here the program is about calculating the volume and surface area of a right circular cylinder.

The program welcome's the user and then asks the user to enter their name.
The program then greets the user with their name.

The program then asks the user to enter the radius for the cylinder and also height.

Finally the program do all the calculations and give the results.

The pictures of the working project are in the Project pictures.docs file.
