Project name: Substitute cipher, in which each letter in the plain text is 'shifted' a certain number of places up or down the alphabet, used to encrypt and decrypt login passwords

Author: Abhijeet Yaduwanshi

Project for: learning java

Skills used: core java

This programs is one of my early java learning lessons.

A type of substitution cipher is the Caesar cipher. This cipher is mono - alphabetic since only one alphabet is used. In a substitution cipher, every letter of the plain text is substituted by the some other letter or symbol. The substitution in the Caesar cipher is based on a shift operation performed on the letters of the plaintext.
For example if the shift is 4, then the standard alphabet "a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z" becomes "e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z,a,b,c,d".
The plaintext message such as "PURCHASE NOW" is encrypted as "TYVGLEWI RSA". Notice that the letter P is shifted as T, the letter U as Y, and so on.

The program is about encrypting the plain test by shifting with caesar cipher and the again decrypting the cipher back to plain text.
Use of JOptionPane java pop-up dialog box(swing).

The first pop-up is for entering the plain text which is to be encrypted.
The second pop-up is for entering the number of shift downward's.

The program will do the logic and shift each alphabet downward's with the shift number, the encrypted text will be shown in the console.

The third pop-up is for entering the cipher text which is to be decrypted.
The final pop-up is for entering the number of shift upward's.

If we enter the same text as we did to encrypt the plain text we will get it back as the decrypted text in the console.

The pictures of the working project are in the Project pictures.docs file.
