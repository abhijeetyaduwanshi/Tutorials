Project name: Calculate the maximum and minimum in the given n numbers

Author: Abhijeet Yaduwanshi

Project for: Data structures and algorithms learning

Skills used: core java

This programs is one of my early data structures and algorithms learning lessons.

In this program I tried learn the basics of data structures and algorithms by taking a simple case study of finding the maximum and minimum of given n numbers.

The program greets the user with the program name and prompts the user to enter their name and says hello user.
The program asks the user to enter the length of the numbers (n).
Then program checks whether n is odd or even.
Then the program asks the user to enter the numbers to compare from.
Finally the program compares the numbers and puts the numbers into two groups namely the Max numbers group and Min numbers group and from those groups the comparison of Min and Max is carried out.

The block diagram of the comparison is explained in MaxMinOfNNumbers.PNG.
