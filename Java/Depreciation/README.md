Author: Abhijeet Yaduwanshi

Project for: learning java

Skills used: core java

This programs is one of my early java learning lessons.

Depreciation is an income tax deduction that allows a taxpayer to recover the cost or other basis of certain property. It is an annual allowance for the wear and tear, deterioration, or obsolescence of the property.
Most types of tangible property (except land), such as buildings, machinery, vehicles, furniture, and equipment are depreciable. Likewise, certain intangible property, such as patents, copyrights, and computer software is depreciable.

The program is about calculating the sum of years depreciation of assets.
The program is be written such that is implements the three types of program control: Sequence, Selection and Repetition.
This project will focus on these programming topics: Numbers and Strings, expressions, statements and Blocks.
Use of multiple methods in a same class.

The program welcome's the user and then asks the user to enter their name.
The program then greets the user with their name.

The program then asks the user to enter the asset information. It will ask the user to enter the type of asset, cost of asset, salvage value and life of asset.
The program will then calculate the depreciable amount and sum of years based on the above entries.

Finally the program do all the calculations and give the final results with each years factors, depreciable amount and the asset cost of that year.
The asset cost will not be depreciated below its salvage value.

The pictures of the working project are in the Project pictures.docs file.
