Project for: learning java

Skills used: core java


This programs is one of my early java learning lessons.
One of the good thing about computer programming is that we can perform a certain task in many different ways.
It’s just like cooking, but one has to follow certain steps to end up with a delicious food.
Exactly like this we can make a computer program in many different ways but have to follow proper steps to get the best results in the end.

Here I have the recipe for fibonacci sequence in three different ways.

The program is about determine the first 10 numbers of fibonacci sequence.

As soon as we run the program we will get the first 10 numbers of fibonacci sequence with their index numbers.
This is not something amazing, but showing it’s versatility, the same results is obtained in all the three programs.
