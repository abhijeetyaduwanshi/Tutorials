Project name: JavaScript Ajax, Dynamic Table, Json Data, Td Color Based on Value.

Author: Abhijeet Yaduwanshi

Project for: learning javascript

Skills used: javascript, ajax, json, html, css

This programs is one of my early javascript learning lessons.

In this program I tried implement some of the JavaScript syntax, Ajax and basic DOM manipulation with JSON data.

Created a single HTML5 file that includes some CSS and JavaScript embedded on the page. The JavaScript functionality that queries a server for JSON data with AJAX and displays it on the page.
Embeded CSS in the head section on that same page and placed all JavaScript in an embedded script tag at the bottom of the body section.
The JSON consist an array of objects. Each object has the following keys: id, gender, first_name, last_name, email, active, title.
When the "Load Data" button is pushed the page does an AJAX request to get the JSON data from the provided server URL.
Then a dynamic table is build with JavaScript using the JSON data provided.
The header row will always be there but before data loads there are no rows below that.
Once the data loads the load button is disabled and the reset button is enabled.
When the "reset" button is pushed the rows from the table are removed. But the table headers on the page always stays.
The active cell in the table highlighted in green if the user has a true value and in red if the value is false.
