Project name: HTML canvas drawing and animation

Author: Abhijeet Yaduwanshi

Project for: learning web development

Skills used: HTML canvas API, JavaScript

This programs is one of my rich internet applications learning lessons.

In this program I tried implement some basic html canvas drawing with animation using canvas API.

Created a single HTML5 file that includes some CSS and JavaScript embedded on the page. The canvas is 600px x 450px.
The canvas is drawn and the animation starts when the Draw Canvas button is pressed.
Canvas has a linear gradient fill in the background (drawn in the canvas not css in the html) from white to black.
Embeded CSS in the head section on that same page and placed all JavaScript in an embedded script tag at the bottom of the body section.
This has a circle, rotating arc, rotating square, triangle, rectangle and a curve with text and image.
When the "Draw Canvas" button is pushed the page gets the canvas and animation running.

Working.... The movie of the working project is canvas.avi file.
