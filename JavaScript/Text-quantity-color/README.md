Project name: Text quantity color.

Author: Abhijeet Yaduwanshi

Project for: learning javascript

Skills used: javascript, html, css

This programs is one of my early javascript learning lessons.

In this program I tried implement some of the JavaScript syntax	and basic DOM manipulation.

Created a single HTML5 file that includes some CSS and JavaScript embedded on the page.
This single file has some basic JavaScript functionality where the scripts gather information from fields and modify the page with basic DOM manipulation.
Embeded CSS in the head section on that same page and placed all JavaScript in an embedded script tag at the bottom of the body section.
Color is a select element with 3 (Red, Green, Blue) colors as choices.
The run lab function gets the input from the two text boxes and the color select menu.
If either text box is empty, used a JavaScript alert prompt to tell the user they must have valid content.
If everything is ok with the text input and quantity, added that quantity of output boxes to the results area.
The box and heading of each box in results area is colored based on the choice in the color drop down.
If the user runs the lab again the results from first run is automatically cleared.
Reset button is disabled if there is no content in the results section. Enable on successful attempt and disable after reset.
