Project name: Caps lock alert for password fields

Author: Abhijeet Yaduwanshi

Project for: learning web development (Internship at Icontrol Networks)

Skills used: HTML, CSS, jQuery

This program was made during my internship at Icontrol Networks (web development).

Working for a company, a developer have to keep a lot of things in mind to develop an error free application.
Password protection is one of a key factor in smart development process.
Almost all applications have case sensitive passwords fields, and a user will never know whether their caps lock button on the key board is turned ON or OFF.
But for a good developer, we have to make sure that the user never struggle with this kind of things.

Here is a small jQuery program that will help user to enter all their case sensitive passwords correctly.

The program is about showing an alert message to the user if their caps lock button on the key board is ON.

There is a password field where the user have to enter their password.
If the user uses the caps lock button to enter the password then their will be an alert box which says them to turn off the caps lock and use shift key to enter the capital alphabets for the password.
Finally when they are done entering the password they may choose to click submit, the password will be printed in the result below our initial field which is wrong but for demonstration purpose I did this to check whether using shift key helps or not.

This small code will take care of all the passwords fields in the application. We donâ€™t have to write separate code for other password fields.

The pictures of the working project are in the Project pictures.docs file.
