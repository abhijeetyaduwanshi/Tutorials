Manage web page with selection of radio buttons

This is a program where we have to select elements or perform some action based on radio buttons.

In the program there are three radio, when we select a particular radio only one action takes place and a highlighted box shows up and rest all actions are disabled.
I have used html on the front side and Jquery for the functionality of the page.

Further more this progam can be mixed and matched with more functionality and can enhance the performance of the web page as required.
