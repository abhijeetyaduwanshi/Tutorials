1.Git Intro, How to download and install
---

Git is a software that is used for maintaining the copies of the code, documents, text etc  
It is simple and helps mostly for version control of the source code

###Download and install Git from internet

While downloading the software keep all the defaults and pay attention to the details (Or at least thats what I did)
1. For the path environment select -> Use Git from Git Bash only
2. Configure the line ending conversions select -> Checkout Windows -style, commit Unix -style line endings

And run the Git Bash and to help us test the working  
Open the Git Bash and run command  
`git --version`  
If it gives the version number then its up and running or else there is a problem and we will have to configure it again
